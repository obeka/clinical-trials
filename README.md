## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

For watch mode during development, run:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), run:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

To run e2e tests in headless mode, use:

```bash
npm run e2e:headless
```

## Linting

To lint your codebase and ensure it adheres to coding standards, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```
